## About the App
**CardioPredict** is a user-friendly tool designed to help individuals assess their risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) using a machine learning model trained on the `cardio_train.csv` dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sulianova/cardiovascular-disease-dataset). The app allows users to input personal health metrics, explore the dataset through interactive visualizations, and learn about the predictive model. The goal is to raise awareness about CVD risk factors and encourage proactive health management.
